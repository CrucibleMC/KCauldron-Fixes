Repository Contents
------------

**BungeeCord**

  - Custom BungeeCord designed for Forge servers in mind. Based on an old
    build of BungeeCord so newer fixes are not included

**KCauldron MobiusCore (Build 156 or below)**

  - Modified version of MobiusCore to work with KCauldron.

**KCauldron MobiusCore (Build 157+)**

  - Modified version of MobiusCore to work with KCauldron.

**Spigot (Hubs or Lobbies Only)**

  - Modified version of Spigot designed to work along side of forge networks.

===================================================================================

Introduction
------------

  The fixes that are included on this repository are for KCauldron and
  Cauldron. The BungeeCord was made to fix certain bugs in BungeeCord
  that have been around for years now. The MobiusCore fixes give you the
  ability to run Opis on your server. The Spigot fix was made for networks
  that use multiple modpacks on their network, but want to have the ability
  to have a hub/lobby on their network for easy access.

===================================================================================

Installations
-------------

**BungeeCord**

  - Exactly the same as the standard BungeeCord. Just replace the main jar
    with the one provided, same with the modules. Also just to be safe,
    rename your bungee.yml to bungee.yml.old & let the modified version
    generate it's own.

**MobiusCore**

  - Just simply drag & drop into your mods folder & it should work fine.

**Spigot**

  - Exactly the same as a normal Spigot server, nothing is different for
    the configuration & such.

===================================================================================

Troubleshooting
---------------

**BungeeCord**

  - Nothing changed after replacing BungeeCord with the files provided from the repository.

```
Create an entirely new folder for BungeeCord & set it up there instead
of replacing the old files. If that doesn't work then you're tough out
of luck since this fix is not being updated. The source URL is provided
below in the [Links] section.
```

  - "Authentication servers are down. Please try again later, sorry!" while
    all mojang servers are still online.

```
Unfortunately this was a bug in the old versions of BungeeCord which
this fix is based off of. Sadly this fix is no longer being updated
so you'll need to find someone to fix this bug for you. The source URL
is provided below in the [Links] section. This bug was fixed in the
latest version of BungeeCord so try & find the code from there to 
backport into this version of Bungeecord.

FAQ

  Q. Who is the creator of KCauldron?
 
```
Prototik
```

  Q. How can I donate to Prototik?

```
You can donate to Prototik through Paypal or YandexMoney at
https://gitlab.prok.pw/KCauldron/KCauldron
```

  Q. Will KCauldron or Cauldron be updated to 1.8 or 1.9?

```
Prototik has stated before that he has no intention to updating the
server software up to 1.8, but he has yet to confirm if KCauldron will
update to 1.9 or not. It's most likely not going to happen so it's
recommended to go with Sponge.
```

  Q. Why are the two fixes BungeeCord & Spigot no longer being updated?

```
Yive never understood nor wanted to learn Java, but noticed that there
were pull requests to Spigot & BungeeCord which were directed at fixing
issues with Forge Clients. So he decided to compile them all together to
create these fixes. If you want to create your own fixes & create a pull
request to Yive's repository, then follow the source link listed above or below.
```

  Q. What are KCauldron backports?

```
Just KCauldron builds that are built against lower versions of Forge.
```
