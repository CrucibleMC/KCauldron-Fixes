FAQ
---

  Q. Who is the creator of KCauldron?
 
```
Prototik
```

  Q. How can I donate to Prototik?

```
You can donate to Prototik through Paypal or YandexMoney at
https://gitlab.prok.pw/KCauldron/KCauldron
```

  Q. Will KCauldron or Cauldron be updated to 1.8 or 1.9?

```
Prototik has stated before that he has no intention to updating the
server software up to 1.8, but he has yet to confirm if KCauldron will
update to 1.9 or not. It's most likely not going to happen so it's
recommended to go with Sponge.
```

  Q. Why are the two fixes BungeeCord & Spigot no longer being updated?

```
Yive never understood nor wanted to learn Java, but noticed that there
were pull requests to Spigot & BungeeCord which were directed at fixing
issues with Forge Clients. So he decided to compile them all together to
create these fixes. If you want to create your own fixes & create a pull
request to Yive's repository, then follow the source link listed above or below.
```

  Q. What are KCauldron backports?

```
Just KCauldron builds that are built against lower versions of Forge.
```
